TODO: __init__ can only take the descriptive params. When nodes are created, the creation can set ID and environment on the base class.

TODO: Have optional make_id, if args are not easily stringifyable.

TODO: We can get the class name using Class.__name__

TODO: Should nodes themselves hold weak refs to parents? Only the GraphManager holds strong refs?

TODO: GraphNode.get_info_message()
